                      <p>Did you know a majority of students take five or six years to complete a four-year degree? These additional semesters add time—and costs—to an important milestone: being a college graduate.</p>
                      <p>UB is leading the charge to help all students graduate in four years through Finish in 4, our commitment to your timely graduation. Our success is in the numbers: 63 percent of inaugural Finish in 4 students graduated on time, better than the national average of 34 percent.</p>
                      <p>When you take the Finish in 4 pledge, you set a goal and chart a path to reach it. Supporting you with clear curricular plans, resources and guidance is how we help you succeed.

                  <h1>Franz DeLeon</h1>
                  <p>Just three years ago, the future as Franz De Leon saw it involved a seat at his first-choice university and a journey abroad with the Peace Corps. So when a letter from his top school sent bad news, Franz had to face something he hadn’t planned on: rejection. “It was hard,” he remembers, “but looking back it seems like it was meant to be.”</p>
                  <p>Happily, Franz ended up at UB. It took just one day on campus—his first-year orientation—for Franz to realize that UB had been the right place all along. This sense of pride may come from the doors UB has opened for him. Whether it’s showing his love for UB as an Orientation Team Leader or immersing himself in cultural clubs that connect him to his Filipino heritage, Franz has built a unique UB experience by jumping at every opportunity to lead and to learn.</p>
                  <p>Being as involved as Franz is a balancing act with an emphasis on time management. Franz knows this now, but it was a different story freshman year. Getting used to college academics and joining one club after another left Franz feeling overextended. Strong feelings of homesickness only added to his stress.</p>
                  <p>Franz knew he needed help, and he wasn’t afraid to ask for it. Franz utilized UB’s extensive network of resources to get back on track. Like many students in need of support, meeting with his advisor was an important step. UB’s advisors are full of knowledge and connections, and they connected Franz to the university’s network of support. Franz notes, though, that it’s really up to the student to put the resources to use: “[Advisors] can connect you with everything you need at UB and will make connections for you, but what you do with that information is your own personal responsibility.”</p>
                  <p>Franz readily shares this advice with the hundreds of new students he leads during orientation. It’s how he uses his own learning experiences to help others at UB. Armed with time management skills and the support provided by the university, Franz is ready to tackle his third year of a rigorous nursing program, which will allow him to help others once he graduates. As for what’s to come after UB, Franz is keeping an open mind. But one thing is certain: “When you believe in yourself and be resilient, you can get through anything.”</p>

                  <h1>Michael Ryman</h1>
                  <p>For Michael Ryman, life starts at the edge of his comfort zone. “It’s where learning begins,” he says. As a history and sociology double major who once intended to be an aerospace engineer, Michael has learned a lot at UB, about both his studies and himself.</p>
                  <p>That includes uncovering a passion for leadership and trying new things, two qualities surprising to someone who had always been known for being extremely shy. Michael credits the amount of opportunities here as the push he needed to break out of his shell. And once he did, he realized there were no limits on what he could do. Studying abroad with SLIDE (Student Leadership International Dialogue and Exchange), serving as an RA for Leadership House, working as a manager in the Student Union, co-founding a social fraternity—Michael has done it all. “I never saw myself being as involved as I am,” he says, “but now I can’t get enough.”</p>
                  <p>It’s a common thread that runs throughout Michael’s time at UB, where his path to self-discovery has continued to evolve with every experience he pursues. At first, though, it took being on the wrong path to discover the right one.</p>
                  <p>Soon after arriving at UB, Michael realized he didn’t want to pursue engineering. Like many students ready to change majors, he didn’t know what would replace it, but he did know he needed to ask for help. Through the support of his mentor and advisors, Michael was reassured that it was OK to make a switch. An aptitude test offered by the Office of Career Services helped him identify subjects that truly interested him. What brought it all together was the breadth of program choices available at UB.</p>
                  <p>Michael knew he had options and that he could change directions without it drastically changing his life. This was especially important as a Finish in 4 student who still had to honor a commitment to graduate in four years. Despite changing his major twice, Michael will still graduate on time—a testament to his work ethic and the support services provided by the university. After UB, Michael has his sights set on law school. He continues to find support and encouragement through UB’s Pre-Law Advising services, which help him make sense of a daunting process.</p>
                  <p>Tapping into UB’s resources and community of support was how Michael turned a confusing time into the start of his success. His resiliency and determination helped, too. Now, he views this experience as a learning opportunity, with one major takeaway: “If you work hard, nothing will stop you.”</p>

                  <h1>Anyssa Evelyn</h1>
                  <p>When Anyssa Evelyn was small, a teacher named Mrs. Rock saw something in her she hadn’t yet realized herself: a natural talent for teaching. It probably showed in Anyssa’s aptitude and attentiveness, but it really came through in her genuine caring for others. It was a trait modeled every day by Mrs. Rock, who showed Anyssa how important it is to help people. “Her teaching didn’t stop at school,” Anyssa notes. “She had a huge influence on my life.”</p>
                  <p>The desire to have this same kind of impact is where Anyssa’s story begins. Growing up in single-parent household equipped her with the skills to be independent and self-reliant. In high school, she excelled in math and science and made a habit of pulling straight-A’s—creating a stellar academic record that brought her to UB as an intended occupational therapy major. OT seemed to provide the perfect combination of science and working with people, but something was missing. Anyssa had always known she wanted to work with kids, but she quickly realized she craved deeper relationships with people than what OT could provide. She kept thinking back on advice Mrs. Rock had given her years ago: Use your smarts in the right field.</p>
                  <p>Like many students, Anyssa found herself at a crossroads.</p>
                  <p>UB’s breadth of academic and extracurricular offerings have given her the ability to explore different paths and get involved—really involved. Though just in her sophomore year, Anyssa is an RA, an orientation leader and a teacher at UB’s daycare center, and she even had a brief stint in the marching band. Anyssa says putting herself out there required confidence, insight she shares with incoming students and students on her floor: “You have to be responsible for yourself. You have to recognize what you need to do to be successful.”</p>
                  <p>Anyssa applied that mindset to her studies, too. While still pursuing occupational therapy, she enrolled in an anatomy class that challenged everything she knew about herself. No matter how hard she worked, it was difficult to succeed in the class. Eventually, she realized she had to switch gears. Anyssa shared her concerns with her advisors. They reassured her that she had the freedom to go back to her original plan if she regretted her decision and pointed her toward resources that helped her make a confident transition.</p>
                  <p>Providing this level of support and encouragement is how UB helped Anyssa identify her true purpose. She’s on track to earning a degree in health and human services with a minor in education. When she enters the public health sector upon graduation, Anyssa can pursue social work, adoption services, community outreach—myriad roles that will allow her to be there for people who need help the most. It’s a lesson an important teacher taught her long ago: Not all teachers are found in classrooms.</p>
