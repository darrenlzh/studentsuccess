      h1 Graduate on time.
      p Did you know a majority of students take five or six years to complete a four-year degree? These additional semesters add time—and costs—to an important milestone: being a college graduate.
      p UB is leading the charge to help all students graduate in four years through Finish in 4, our commitment to your timely graduation. Our success is in the numbers: 63 percent of inaugural Finish in 4 students graduated on time, better than the national average of 34 percent.
      p When you take the Finish in 4 pledge, you set a goal and chart a path to reach it. Supporting you with clear curricular plans, resources and guidance is how we help you succeed.
