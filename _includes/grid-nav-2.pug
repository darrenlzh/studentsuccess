      p Success in college requires personal responsibility. We know you have it, but we also know that, from time to time, you may need an extra push to succeed. UB’s Early Alert initiative is designed to reach students who may benefit from a little extra guidance.
      p At UB, we want you to assume the controls of your academic career knowing that help and support is here when you need it. Through Early Alert, our staff can identify students who may be at risk of falling off their path. Our proactive outreach and early intervention is how we get you back on it—and how we help you stay there.
      p Through connecting you to a network of resources, provide thoughtful, solid advice, or identify opportunities to overcome difficulties, we are ready to support you and keep you on track to academic success.
